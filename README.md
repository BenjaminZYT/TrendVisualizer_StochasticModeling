Trend Visualizer with Stochastic Modeling (Beta Stage)

Overview
The Trend Visualizer allows users to view historical price or traded volume data alongside two trend lines for comparison. Additionally, it provides a stochastic model simulation. The available models are:
- Geometric Brownian Motion Model
- Merton Jump-Diffusion Model
- Mean Reverting Model
- Cox-Ingersoll-Ross Model

How To Use
- Select a Ticker Symbol: Use the dropdown menu to choose from 30 Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA) tickers and three additional tickers: ^IRX, ^TYX, and ^SPX.
- Input Field: Enter ticker symbols not available in the dropdown menu.
- Choose Data Type: Select between OHLC (Open, High, Low, Close) data or “Volume.”
- Select Data Range: Specify the number of years back for historical data.
- Plot Trend Lines: Click “Go” to generate trend line plots.
- View Stochastic Models: After generating the trend plot, select a stochastic model from the dropdown menu and click “View Model” to display the model simulation.
- Simulate Multiple Outcomes: Click “View Model” repeatedly to observe different outcomes for the selected model, or choose a different model to view its simulation results.

Important Notes
- Data Source: Data is sourced from Yahoo Finance.
- Model Calibration: Model parameters are currently uncalibrated. The provided models offer a general representation of their features for most tickers.
- Plot Issues: Some plots may not display due to overflow or division by very small numbers. Future updates will aim to improve handling of such issues.
- Reset Function: Use the “Reset” button before selecting a different ticker to avoid conflicts between different datasets.
